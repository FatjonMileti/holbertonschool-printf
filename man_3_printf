.SH NAME
.B _printf
- Formatted output conversion.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.TP
#include "main.h"
.TP
_printf(const char *format, ...);
.SH DESCRIPTION
The function _printf() writes output to
.I stdout,
the standard output stream. It writes the output under the control of a format string that specifies how subsequent arguments (or arguments accessed via the variable-length argument facilities of stdarg(3)) are converted for output.
.SS Return value
Upon successful return, this function returns the number of characters printed (excluding the null byte used to end output to strings).
If an output error is encountered, a negative value is returned.
.SS Format of the format string
The format string is a character string, beginning and ending in its initial shift state, if any. The format string is composed of zero or more directives: ordinary characters (not %), which are copied unchanged to the output stream; and conversion specifications, each of which results in fetching zero or more subsequent arguments. Each conversion specification is introduced by the character %.
